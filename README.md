# About

Debate the merits of node.js all you want, but it sure does make writing IRC bots easy.

This one will respond as though it were a lead actor in the film classic "Dude, Where's My Car."

# Configuration

The following environment variables can be used, and have the below fallbacks
if not specified:

    export SWEETDUDEBOT_SERVER='chat.freenode.net'
    export SWEETDUDEBOT_PORT=6667
    export SWEETDUDEBOT_CHANNEL='#yourchannel'
    export SWEETDUDEBOT_NICK='sweetdudebot'

# Lineage

This bot is a quick hack off of [node-sedbot](https://github.com/smerrill/node-sedbot).
